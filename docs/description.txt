Configurator
============

This package provides tools for creating application configuration
stores. It is agnostic of both the source of configuration and its
use. Its purpose in life is to make the process of obtaining and using
a tree of configuration data as painless as possible.

To this end, it also includes tools to parse configurations from
common file formats and examples of common use cases.
